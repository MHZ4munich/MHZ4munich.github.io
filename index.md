Meihuazhuang is a traditional Chinese martial art which has a named history of 400 years (the origin dates back much longer). The trainings focus on improving the inner state of the practiser (Jing, Qi, and Shen, which is the spiritual strength) and are composed of Jiazi (Dynamic meditation with fixed body position) , Chengquan (harmonic attack and defend), Qixie (weapons) and various auxillary trainings. It aims at improving the health status both physically and mentally and building up self-defence skills. 

Meihuazhuang is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and philosophy which is a delicate Dao. This unique sport and art is widespread in Europe: which reinforces the friendship among people from different countries, as well as offers a perfect cultural diversity.

The meaning of Meihua is plum blossom which bloom in the coldest winter time in China, a metaphor
for persistence and self-reliance in face of difficulty, while zhuang means stump, which is a basic
training method also found in Tai-chi, Wing-chun, etc.
