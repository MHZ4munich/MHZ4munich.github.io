Please click on the events in the calendar below to see the address where we meet for each training. The meeting and training place for the coming week will always be fixed before 8:00 pm on the current Saturday. 

The training always start on time so it is important for participant to be punctual !

We vary training places because we want to compensate for the fact that members come from different parts of Munich. You're welcome to propose new places for training. Currently we are using West park and Leopold park.
