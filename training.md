**The training always start on time so it is important for participants to be punctual !**

The meeting and training place for the coming week will always be fixed before 8:00 pm on the current Saturday but it is always a good habit to look at the calendar on the day before you go to confirm the place or contact us for probe training.

**In terms of bad weather like raining, the training will be cancelled automatically without notification, this is according to the hourly weather forecast widget at the bottom.**  



We vary training places because we want to compensate for the fact that members come from different parts of Munich. You are welcome to propose new places for training.
