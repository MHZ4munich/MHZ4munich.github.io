The training is on a weekly basis and most of the time we alternate between West park and English Garden in Munich for training. Note that currently we train outdoor so our training is affected by the weather, so look at **the weather widget below** before you go. **In terms of bad weather, the training is cancelled automatically without notification.**  

Please click on the events in the calendar below to see the address where we meet for each training and other details like how to find us. 

The meeting and training place for the coming week will always be fixed before 8:00 pm on the current Saturday but it is always a good habit to look at the calendar on the day before you go to confirm the place or contact us for probe training.

**The training always start on time so it is important for participants to be punctual !**

We vary training places because we want to compensate for the fact that members come from different parts of Munich. You are welcome to propose new places for training.
